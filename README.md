# CHME 5137 Filtration Study
In this study, we delve into assessing performance of depth filters in treating wastewater.  A common application, there is yet room for improvement concerning efficiency and effectiveness of filtration.  In the recent past, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have begun to pose themselves as highly tunable for many applications.  This study intended to first model filtration through a depth filter, then understand parameter significance in model output (concentration of particles in effluent), and finally make recommendations for designing filters.

## Motivation
As students at Northeastern University enrolled in the CHME 5137 - Computational Modeling in Chemical Engineering - we were tasked with identifying a research project and applying our learned coding knowledge to solving a research-related project.  To do this, we implemented Python and MATLAB code to perform partial differential equation (PDE) solving and sensitivity analysis.  The particular method of PDE solving was the Crank-Nicolson method, a finite difference method.  With an over-simplification of the given depth filtration system, we were able to perform modeling and analysis accordingly.
